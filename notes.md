My slightly profane and crass notes for Advent of Code Problems.

Nothing I put here should be taken as a critizism of the contest itself,
which is amazingly well done and awesome.


# 2020

## Day 16 - Ticket Translation

Can you manage to use some range rules to determine what things maps to what things.
Then repeat that as you reduce the number of outstanding things.

## Day 17 - Conway Cubes

### Part 1
Can you do Conway's game of life in 3d?  Easy, just don't screw up the neighbors.

### Part 2
What about 4D?  Ha ha ha.  Don't worry about visualizing it.  Also, debugging is impossible.
Don't write bugs.


## Day 18 - Operation Order

Can write an expression processor for some bullshit math rules.  Also, use longs.

## Day 19 - Monster Messages

Recursive decent parser.  Or something.



## Day 20 - Jurassic Jigsaw

In this problem you have a bunch of 2d map tiles that you need to stitch together
where they match up.

### Part 1

Can you rotate and flip?  Can you do a recursive search?  Not super hard but lots of details.

### Part 2

Now do some more silly modifications and look for given pattern.

## Day 21 - Allergen Assessment

Use logic to make conclusions about mappings of items to alergens.

### Part 1 

Do some basic logic.

### Part 2

Find the full mapping.  If you did part 1 in a reasonable way, this is easy.


## Day 22 - Crab Combat

Crab war cards.

### Part 1

Can you follow basic rules. 

### Part 2

Can you manage some oddly phrased recusion rules.

## Day 23 - Crab Cups

Those crabs want to play some weird cup game.

### Part 1

Can you manipulate a linked list of things with some sort of cursor and add and remove
things without screwing up?

### Part 2

Times 10 million because fuck your cpu and your shit ArrayList implementation



## Day 24 - Lobby Layout

Some hex grid for a hotel lobby.

### Part 1 

Can you walk a hex grid without tripping on own face?

### Part 2

Now play conways game of life on it.

## Day 25 - Combo Breaker

Some weird public key RFID thing.  Basically do pow-mod a bunch
or don't.  Whatever.

### Part 1

Can you write a for loop?  You think it is complicated, but it isn't.

### Part 2

Did you get all the stars and can you press a button?
It took me almost three minutes to press the button.
